Our goals for \(swift) are ambitious: we want to make programming simple things easy, and difficult things possible \(year). For students, learning \(swift) has been a great introduction to modern programming concepts and best practices. And because it is open, their \(swift) skills will be able to be applied to an even broader range of platforms, from mobile devices to the desktop to the cloud.")
